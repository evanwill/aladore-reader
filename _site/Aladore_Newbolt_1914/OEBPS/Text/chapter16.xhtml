    HOW YWAIN FOUND HIS LADY AGAIN, AND HOW SHE WENT FROM HIM THE SECOND TIME.</h2>

    <p class="firstParagraph">LONG time was Ywain musing on that which had befallen him by night, and it seemed to him that he had been made to live as it were in two lives, seeing that out of one sleep he had twice awaked. And of the truth of this he had no certainty, but of his service that he had sworn to his lady, of that he had certainty, for whether in his dream or out of his dream his heart assented thereto. Moreover, he desired greatly to come again to that house where he had seen her go from him: and if such a house there were in Paladore, he doubted not to find it, for he saw yet before his eyes the shield of arms that was there beside the door, and it was party of sable and silver, with a ship sailing therein counter-coloured.</p>

    <p>But now while he was musing came a messenger from Sir Rainald, and entreated him of his courtesy that he would be with Sir Rainald shortly, for he had that to say to Ywain which was worth his hearing. So Ywain went with the messenger and came to Sir Rainald. Then Sir Rainald spoke to him slowly and with many words, as men speak of grave matters: and he told Ywain how he was commanded to bring him that same day before the Prince of Paladore, and he gave him joy therewith, for he said that the honour was great, and such as fell not commonly to them that were strangers, but if they were on some embassage.</p>

    <p>Then Ywain thanked him in such words as were fitting, and so covered his thought: for in his old life he had had knowledge of princes and he was well-a-way weary even to remember them. Yet for the desire that he had to meet again with his lady, and to do her service, he was willing to pleasure Sir Rainald and the Prince and any other. So when an hour had been set, that he should meet with Sir Rainald before the door of the Great Gard, then Ywain took his leave and was gone until the evening.</p>

    <p>And first he came hastily to his own house: for before any other thing that he might do he was set to find that house of the shield, and he thought to go by the way of his dream. And he found the way like as he remembered it, and came before the house and saw the shield: and he entered into the house, for the door was unlatched and there was no man to stay him or to answer him. Yet he entered not so easily, for the door stood heavy against his hand and cried out upon him: and he perceived that the hinges of it were eaten with old rust. Also upon the inward side of it was much cobweb of spiders, and in the hallway dust like grey sand upon the flags. Then he went from chamber to chamber, and they were all wide and waste in like manner: and his eyes were darkened to look upon the place, and his heart was cold within him, for he saw it as a place of the dead that was mouldering and forgotten.</p>

    <p>Then at the last he came into a little chamber that was high above the hall: and it was the chamber of all the house that was most richly hung and furnished, and in it was a lute and a book and a frame of broidery, and upon the wall a round mirror of glass. And he came to the mirror and stood still to look into it, and when he looked the blood leapt in his heart as a horse leaps to the spur: for in the glass was the chamber made small and clear, as it were far off, and all things in order as he had seen them, save only that before the frame of broidery he saw a lady sitting at the work. And for all the bending of her head and the shadow upon her, he knew well that she was his own lady; and he kept watch upon her where he stood, for to move him from the mirror he dare not, lest she should go from him again.</p>

    <p>Then he saw in the glass how she raised her head, and looked: and in that same instant the mirror was filled with cloud, and he turned him swiftly about in great fear. But his fear was vain, for his lady was verily there before him sitting, and by her the book and the lute, and all things in the chamber. And she gave him no greeting, but bent still to her broidery and made as though he had been long time there with her. And presently she bade him take the lute and sing thereto: and her voice was light and careless, as of one that thought most of her own business.</p>

    <p>Then he was ashamed, for he had no skill with the lute, and he prayed her forgiveness humbly. Then she said it was no matter, but that he should take the book and read to her. And he took the book, and opened it: but every word that was in it was written in an unknown tongue, so that he was ashamed for this time also. Then again she said it was no matter, but for a little while she was silent: and afterward she bade him look from the window and tell her of that which he saw. So he came to the window, that was an oriel and high above ground: and before it and beneath lay the ridge tiles of the city, and beyond them was a wall with battlements, and above the battlements was a long line and dim, where the sky met with the sea.</p>

    <p>Then he said to his lady, I see some part of the city hereunder, and what shall I say of it to do you pleasure? But she answered him that he should look not upon the city, but beyond it. Then he said to her, I see above the battlements a dimness of blue, and in it is a line where the sky meets with the sea: and what more shall I say of it to do you pleasure? And she answered him not, but left her broidering and so came and stood beside him at the window, and they two looked upon the sea together. And at the last she said to him, Look well now and tell me all: for I see that of which you have not told me. And he looked again, shading his eyes with his hand and peering carefully: but nothing could he see, save one dimness upon another.</p>

    <p>Then an evil thought came into his mind, and he said within himself, This is her will, to put shame upon me, and to make me speak of that which I see not, as though I saw it with my eyes. Then he looked once again, and as he looked he spoke, and in his voice was a little grain of anger, as small as the sand that grits between the teeth. And he said, I see nothing where nothing is: and in that instant he heard his lady sigh, there as she stood beside him; and sorrow came upon him to hear her, and he would have turned to yield himself. And he turned and found her not, for in the taking of a breath she was gone from him.</p>
