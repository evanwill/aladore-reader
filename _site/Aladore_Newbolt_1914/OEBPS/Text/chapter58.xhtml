    OF A TOMB THAT WAS FOUND IN PALADORE, AND OF DIVERS SAYINGS THAT WERE HEARD CONCERNING IT.</h2>

    <p class="firstParagraph">IN the same hour came a noise of shouting from the West, and Hubert and his broke in upon the battle. And they struck upon the spearmen as the wood-knife strikes upon the ashlings, so that there was neither resistance nor recovery, but all laid to length upon the ground. And when they had made an end of their enemies, then they sought busily to find their fellows, if there might be any with the life yet in them. And they found of them one here and another there, for they were buried beneath the slain: but Ywain and Aithne they found not, neither sign of them, neither report.</p>

    <p>And when it was morning light then they made search again: and they came into the chapel wherein Aithne had been in sanctuary. And there also they sought, and when they came before the altar and saw the tomb that was thereby, then they found that which they sought not. For upon the tomb were two lying in semblance of a man and a woman: but they were fashioned of black bronze after the manner of the tombs of kings. And the faces of them were the faces of Ywain and Aithne, and they lay there as they had been sleeping.</p>

    <p>And they which saw them marvelled: and one said: They are here sleeping, and belike they will come again from their sleep. And another said: Nay, how shall this be; for they were but man and woman, like unto ourselves. But Hubert rebuked them both, for he said: They are not here but otherwhere, and their sleep is but a semblance. And doubtless the pilgrim hath achieved his pilgrimage, for he learned of his lady: and she came and went of her own magic, and had from her birth the Rhymer's heritage.</p>
