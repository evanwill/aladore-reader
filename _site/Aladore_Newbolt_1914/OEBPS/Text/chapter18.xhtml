    OF PALADORE AND OF THE PRINCES THEREOF.</h2>

    <p class="firstParagraph">RIGHT so came the sound of trumpets from within the battlements: and Hubert started up upon his feet and said joyfully how it was the trumpets in the Great Gard blowing to hall. And he made Ywain also to rise up and go with him: and he brought him again through the gate and into the city, and so to his own lodging, and there Hubert would have Ywain to dine with him and with certain others. And of those others one was named Maurice and another Bartholomy and the third Dennis, and they were all the three of them young men and restless in their speech as was Hubert himself. So they five talked together all the time of dinner, and afterward they rose not from the table but continued talking.</p>

    <p>And as reason was, so it happened in their talk, that there was ever one that made question and four that answered: whereby at the last it seemed to Ywain that his head span round, for they four smote him with strange sayings on this side and on that, as boys will smite a top and spin it. And when they had told him the customs of Paladore concerning war and witchcraft and marriage, then they told him of the clergy and the Court. And of clergy they said that there was scarce one to be seen in all the city, for the great ones believed them not and the commons loved them not: therefore they banished them for the most part, yet not far off, lest evil should come thereby, or some sudden need. But the Archbishop they kept still within the city, for he was of the company of the Tower, or at the least so they thought of him. And of churches they made no account, but left them there: yet for the hope of Paradise there were many that went pilgrimage.</p>

    <p>Then they all praised the Prince some deal, but of the Court they told Ywain such things as men will tell of Courts, and in part he believed them and in part he believed them not: for in his time he also had told the like and found it otherwise. But this much he heard of Maurice and took it for truth, namely that by old custom none could be Prince in Paladore save that he were a giant of his stature and of his lineage: also must no Prince take a wife save that she likewise came of giants, to the end that the same estate and goodliness might remain unto their children's children. And by this counsel, said Maurice, it came to pass that being no more of one kind with smaller folk, he that was Prince could not have ado with his people, neither in battle nor in love: but he had of them great reverence, for all men praised the doing of his lineage in time past. Moreover upon high days there would go lords before him, bearing a great sword and a crown of tourney: and when they of Paladore saw the Prince accompanied therewith, there was then no renown that they would not believe of him.</p>

    <p>So said Maurice, and Bartholomy laughed and said further, It is true enough, yet this also is true, that our Prince is no free man, but lives in durance all his life-days. For by no old custom, but belike by fear of his greatness, it is forbidden that he come abroad into the city without he be guarded by armed guards, lest perchance he should some time break forth and go his own ways. Moreover it is provided that in his own house also, and whether he be eating or drinking or what else doing, he shall in any case be bound with chains: and in the making of such chains they of Paladore have great skill, for they will tie a man hand and foot with bonds of no seeming substance, and yet past breaking of any, save he be strongly holpen of friends. Then Dennis laughed also, and he said Nay, but this one thing you have forgotten, how that our Princes have leave for all manner of hunting and fowling: and they go freely into all such forests as are large enough, and strike all such game as shall come near enough. For though they ride not with hounds, lest their horses fall down under so great weight, yet will they stand in covert the day long with marvellous endurance, to shoot at such few birds and beasts as may be driven forth to them. And this is well done, for in Paladore good hunting brings good will, and the Prince thereby has the love of all his people. And their love fails not, but increases continually: for they hold this Prince that now is, to be better than his father, and he also was better, as it is reported, than any that was before him: and certainly in the old time they killed not their game so easily, nor one fourth part of the number thereof.</p>

    <p>Then said Ywain, I perceive plainly that this is a good Prince, but I am yet to seek wherefore he should desire my presence. And Hubert and Maurice and Bartholomy and Dennis when they heard Ywain say so, they were astonished, for they knew not of the sending of Sir Rainald; and they ceased from their laughing as men cast suddenly into fear. And Hubert said, This is of the Tower, for I know their handiwork of old. Then Ywain said merrily, By seeming I also am a beast of the game. But they four laughed no more, and Ywain perceived that there was no merriness left in them: for they dreaded the favour of the Tower, whereby they might lose their man as soon as they had gained him. And in no long while after Ywain took his leave of them: and he hastened and came to Sir Rainald, for it was time.</p>
