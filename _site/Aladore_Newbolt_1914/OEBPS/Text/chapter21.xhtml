    OF THE ADVENTURE OF THE CASTLE OF MAIDENS AND HOW YWAIN WAS COUNSELLED TO ESCAPE THEREFROM.</h2>

    <p class="firstParagraph">Now for this adventure Ywain had great honour of all the commons, for there was no sort of fighting that they did not love, and they gave praise above measure to him that could bring men into his obedience. Wherefore they were not willing that Ywain should meet as yet with the Howling Beast, for by that adventure they had lost many that should have been great men for them. So they went clamouring that he might be assigned a day for the Castle of Maidens, for that was an adventure without pain and without peril, as the most of them deemed: howbeit others there were that thought otherwise.</p>

    <p>Then the Prince consented to their clamour, being counselled thereto by them of the Tower: for they looked to have Ywain either this way or that, and by favour first, if it might be so, but if not, then by foul work, as by the Beast. So on the third day they came again to Ywain with smooth faces, and they brought him forth to a great castle that was named the Castle of Maidens: and it stood a three mile from the city, in a meadow toward the sun-rising. And thither resorted all the lords of Paladore and great part of the commons, by hundreds and by thousands: and in the midst of them went Ywain with a twenty more that were of his company. And these were all young and lusty men, of lineage and wealth sufficient, and they took Ywain for their captain and banneret.</p>

    <p>So they came to the castle anon, and found barriers thereby and lists set ready: and Ywain and his company went within the lists. And against them there came forth as many others, for to do battle with them: but the custom was that they fought not with weapons of war, but with spears of wood only. For upon the walls of the castle were many maidens, both young and old; and though they might not all be young, yet were they all too tender to look upon wounds and death. And they were apparelled in hoods of clear colours, right joyous and well-beseen, like flowers arow upon the wall: and they ceased not from making a high sweet noise among themselves, as it were the noise of swallows upon a ridge-tile.</p>

    <p>Then Ywain and his were armed and came riding merrily to tourney. And they bestirred themselves in the best manner, so that in one hour they had the castle yielden and in mercy: for they that kept it fought but for the custom's sake, and had no force to make good their keeping. Then when he had received the keys, Ywain entered into the castle with all his company: and there the maidens unarmed them and brought them to hall, that they might eat and drink and make ready to fulfil all the custom.</p>

    <p>Now the custom of the castle was this, that whosoever should have the mastery thereof and enter as by conquest, never might he and his depart again therefrom save first they should be wedded, every man with a maiden of the castle. And they were all, both men and maids, no better than blindfold, for the manner of their wedding was by lot. And when the time for the lotting was come, the maidens sat together in a gallery, among such as were of their blood and fellowship: and they were all diversely clad in silken gear, no two alike, but every one of one only colour. Then they that had won the castle were brought in before them in coats of silk; and the coats also were diverse and no two alike, but every one of one only colour. And the colours of the maidens and of the men were such as each one pleased, according to their fantasy: and the maidens knew not of the men, nor they of the maidens, how they would make choice: but when they came in presence, if any were matched in their colours then those two were wedded together and so departed from the castle to their own place.</p>

    <p>Then when Ywain heard tell of the custom he was vexed with indignation, for he saw how he had been snared unwitting. And he went hither and thither, as it might be a young wolf raging in the net: but all the doors of the castle were barred and bolted, so that there was no escape. Then by chance he came upon an old dame, that was there within a little chamber alone: and he made excuse and would have taken his leave of her. But she called to him and said, Good Sir, what ails you? And he answered her, Good Madam, what think you? Shall a man be wedded by custom and by chance? Then she said, So are the most of men wedded; but if you will verily, it may be that I shall help you therefrom. Yea, verily, said Ywain, for I am bounden otherwhere.</p>

    <p>Then the old dame put forth her hand and made to give him somewhat, and when he had handled it he perceived that it was a silken coat, and the colour of it was of black, both within and without. And she said to him, Take this and abide the lotment, for it is not to be heard of among a million of maidens that any hath chosen black for her wedding. Then Ywain considered of her counsel, and saw that it was good: and though it had not been good yet he could not better it. So he made to leave her, but first he thanked her heartily: and that old dame looked kindly upon him, as with remembrance. And Ywain's heart trembled within him, for he saw beneath her looks the image of his lady, as beneath a many old faces may be seen the beauty that was there aforetime.</p>

    <p>So he went from her to abide the lotment: and as she had said, even so it was, for there was none among the maidens that had black to her colour. Then all were matched save Ywain, and he only was left there unmatched: so that every man might see how he had taken counsel to escape. And some said that he had not wholly achieved the adventure, and others said that he had achieved it twice over, for he had prevailed both without the castle and within.</p>

    <p>Howbeit they brought him forth with the rest that were all matched and wedded, and they came cityward with a great noise of shouting. And as they went Ywain fell aweary of them and of their customs: and the sun set and the night rose on Paladore.</p>
