    HOW YWAIN SAW THE CITY OF THE SAINTS THE FIRST TIME AND HOW HE HEARD THE BELLS THEREOF.</h2>

    <p class="firstParagraph">Now was Ywain once more upon pilgrimage: yet he had not that joy which he had aforetime, when he left his house of Sulney. For then he went of his own will and followed after the boy, that was no stranger to his blood: but now he was lonely and without desire, and though he had somewhat to seek, yet his going moved rather from despair. Also the sky was changed above him, for the year began to leave summer and to turn towards winter, and the green was brown and the brown yellowing, and the nights coldened and the days drew in. Moreover Ywain walked not so willingly with all his company: for some of them were but ale-knights which had repented them when they were adrunken, and some were swashers home from war, and others there were which loved anguishment above all, and being feeble goers would make themselves yet feebler, with peasen underfoot and hairy shirts and bodycords about them. Neither were they wholly at one in their emprise: for the half of them were in hope to be at rest in the City of the Saints, and the other half to be speedily at war against their enemies, so that many times when they sang their singing was diverse, and their fellowship most like to go agrief.</p>

    <p>And in no long time this came to pass. For when they were a ten days gone upon their way, they that were angriest among them departed from the feeble ones: and they set off across country at great random, saying how they would take the city by assault and keep it against all others. Then they that remained went every day slower and more slow, and though they had all one weariness yet had they not all one mind. For they fell into much doubt and dispute concerning their two guides: whereof the one was a young lad that knew but little of that country, and the other was an old man and blind these many years. So at the last they were severed again into two bands and went their ways: for they that went with the youngling said how they would build a new city and forsake the old, but Ywain and a five or six more went not with them, for Bartholomy entreated Ywain against his will.</p>

    <p>Then they set forward again, and came to a country of hills: and before they entered upon the hills the old blind fell adying that was their guide. And they found a warm village under the hills, and left him there, for it was plain to see that his time was come. Then Ywain and Bartholomy thought to go their way, to find the city or to end in seeking it; but they that had come so far would go no farther with them, for they were afeard to leave their guide, or living or dead.</p>

    <p>So these twain entered alone upon the hills, and came through them in three days: and when they had passed through they saw the city there below them. And it lay in the midst of a plain, upon a hill that was but a great mound, with a river thereby like silver flowing: and the sea was fast by beneath the sun-setting, and the river went thereto through meadows and through boskage.</p>

    <p>Then Ywain and Bartholomy came down towards the foothills and drew nearer to the city: and when they were upon the foothills they saw it over against them in marvellous wise. For the walls of it were of a white old age, with great bastions between all rounded, and before the walls were meadows and above them were massy trees. And within the city the roofs were of red and of grey, and among the roofs were spires and domes and high towers innumerable: and Ywain saw them clearly against the sky, and they were all passing beautiful, and not one of them like another. And there lay upon the city an enchantment, like to a mist or dimness upon it: for to such as stood without and looked upon it and beheld the walls and the gardens and the high towers thereof, to them it seemed ever to be abiding in ancientry and peace, as of no earthly city, but to those within it showed after another fashion.</p>

    <p>And while Ywain and Bartholomy stood still looking upon the city the sun set and dusk came round about them; and in the dusk they saw a glimmering of lights. And they perceived that in that city was full plenty of chapels and of halls: for on every side there were great windows, and in the windows were many lights shining, rich and orderly, window by window aline upon the darkness. Also they heard suddenly a ringing of bells, so many and so sweet to hear, that they were astounded with the harmony of them: for they sounded one under another, as it might be under deep and shallow water. And there was one great bell which donged below all other: and the sound of it came up to Ywain like a sound from the bottom of the sea.</p>
