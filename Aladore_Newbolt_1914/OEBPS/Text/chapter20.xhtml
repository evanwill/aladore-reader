    OF THE ADVENTURE OF THE CHESS, AND BY WHAT MEANS YWAIN BROUGHT HIS MEN INTO OBEDIENCE.</h2>

    <p class="firstParagraph">So within a while came letters to Ywain appointing him a day for the adventure of the Chess. And on the day appointed he looked forth from his house and saw how there stood before the door a company of great ones, and they called to him courteously and showed him a horse that was made ready for him. And when he came out to them they let cover him with a cloak of silver and blue, and they gave him for his head a cap of silver with a plume of blue, and he perceived that his horse was furnished in the like colours. Then they brought him to the gate of the city that looked toward the South, and one of them told him by what way he should go, and how it behoved him to come before noon to the Castle of the Chess, and so prove the adventure. Also another of them cast a baldrick and a horn about his neck, and said how that without doubt it should fortune to him as he should deserve, and if so be that he achieved the adventure then when he came again he should come blowing upon the horn, that his friends might make ready betimes to meet him. And some there were that laughed thereat, and among their faces Ywain saw the face of Sir Rainald.</p>

    <p>Then he set forth, and he rode at an easy pace, for the morning was yet hoar with the dew of night and the gossamer upon the grass. And when he had passed over the high land that was before the city he came to a river and forded it, and so took the forest and went by a green road therein. And before noon he was aware of a castle that stood above the forest, and he entered in at the gate of it and came to the hall and alighted down from off his horse. And he marvelled at the manner of the castle, for he found none there to stay or to speed him, neither in the gatehouse neither within guard: yet was the hall well kept and furnished, with meat and drink on table and new rushes thereunder. Also there was a great bell above that sounded to dinner without hand or rope: so that it was easy to perceive that the place was enchanted by sorcery.</p>

    <p>Now when Ywain had well dined he fell into a study, not knowing what more he was to do. And as he studied he heard a noise without the hall, but of what the noise might be he could not tell, for it was faint as wind or water. So he arose and went into a bay window that was beside the high table, and there was a great lattice there which stood wide open, and he came to it and looked out. And he saw there a courtyard that lay beneath the window, and the floor of it was chequy sable and white after the fashion of the tables of chess, whereby he knew that he was come to his adventure. And thereby also he perceived the meaning of the noise that he heard: for even as he looked there came out of a cloister two companies apparelled after the fashion of the chess, as it were pawns and bishops and the like, on this side and on the other. And they of the other side were all in cloth of gold with red bordures, but they of the side that was Ywain's were all in cloth of silver with bordures of blue, and of the rustling of the cloth of gold and of silver came that noise aforesaid, and other noise was there none, but that only, and the sound of it was like the whispering of the wind in an ambush.</p>

    <p>Then Ywain looked to see who was he that should play with him: and he saw how that beyond the chequer there was a window opened, over against the window wherein he stood. And in that window was a shadow, and in the shadow a semblance like to the semblance of a man : but between the windows came the sunlight broad upon the chequer, and for the glare of it he had no certainty of that which was within the shadow.</p>

    <p>Then he saw that the two companies were all in order arrayed upon the chequer, and the game awaiting for him: and he thought how he would send his pawn forward according to the usage, but he spoke no word as yet, for he had no desire to hear his own voice in that place. Nevertheless the pawn moved as he would have it, and immediately a pawn of the gold moved also to meet him: whereby Ywain perceived that the manner of the game was not by speaking but by thinking, and when he thought again to command a piece, then that piece also moved according to his thought.</p>

    <p>Thus began the playing upon this side and upon that: and in the beginning Ywain had the advantage, and he looked presently to have the mastery. But the way thereto was long and tangled, and the end fell suddenly into doubt. For when the time of the stroke was come Ywain perceived that either his remembrance had failed him in strange wise, or else that he had been undone by a knight of his: for whereas by his intention the knight should have been upon the sable, now he was found upon the white, and so out of distance for the stroke. Then was Ywain in great peril, but he fought warily to recover his game, and rebutted stoutly and so came again into good hope.</p>

    <p>But with the misadventure and the doubt, and with the slowness of the playing, the day was wellnigh passed over, and the shadow of the battlements crept softly upon the chequer. Then the sun fell more quickly to the high tower of the castle, and was gone behind it suddenly, and a little wind stirred in the coldness of his going. And Ywain saw how the wind caught the gold and silver pieces as it were in a whirlpool, and it carried them away under the cloister wherefrom they had issued: and they went after the manner of dead leaves, rustling and eddying by no motion of their own. And he marvelled greatly thereat, for he had supposed them to be men like himself, but now he doubted.</p>

    <p>Then he went to sup and to sleep, and found all things made ready as before, but the silence of the place choked him and the solitariness lay deathwardly upon his spirit. Yet he remembered how he had that day been near to win his game, and he thought well to amend it on the morrow and give mate before the time of sunset. But therein his hope deceived him, for again on the morrow his fortune was at odds with his force, and when he came to make his stroke he was undone by the transgression of his men: so that his battle was disordered until sunset and the wind right welcome to break off the game.</p>

    <p>And when he thought thereon, despair came upon him, because he saw that the obedience of his company was not as the obedience of those others. And when he came to his bed he lay long waking, and he cast every way for counsel how he might make his thought to prevail more perfectly. Then in the last hour of the night he rose up out of his bed and came softly down into the cloister to see the truth of the companies, for his mind was so busy that he could not sleep. And when he was come down the day was breaking, and he found the men all together, the gold with the silver, and they lay this way and that upon the stones of the cloister, even as the wind had drifted them: and by seeming they were light and hollow, like the barren mast beneath a beech-tree.</p>

    <p>Then Ywain stood looking upon them, and as he looked the sun rose and he saw a marvel: for with the sun rising their life came again into them, and they began to breathe and stir as men breathe and stir in their sleeping. Then he put forth his hand and touched one and another of them: and when he had touched them all, he perceived that they of the gold party were every one ruddy and warm of flesh, but they of the silver were all white and cold as mushrooms. And in the same instant he knew the truth of their disobedience: for he said within himself, They fight in my quarrel, but the heat of my blood they lack.</p>

    <p>Right so he knew what he must do: and he took the hermit's knife that was about his neck, and loosed it from the sheath, and with the point of it he pierced his breast strongly, so that the blood came forth in good plenty, and the pain drew at the roots of his heart. And he came again to them of the silver company and with his own blood he touched them upon the lips, until he had be-bled them all: but the gold ones he touched not, for there was no need. And last of all he touched the Queen, and she awoke and rose up and looked upon him as with remembrance: and she put forth her hand in turn and touched him upon the breast, and immediately the pain ceased and the blood was stayed. And Ywain's heart trembled as she looked at him: for beneath her looks he saw his lady's image, as men see faces in the fire. But she let close her eyes again and turned her from him and so fell suddenly to her sleep.</p>

    <p>Then Ywain entered into great meditation and continued long therein, so that he walked in meditation and ate and drank the same to his dinner and came unawares to the hour of the adventure. But when the pieces were now arrayed and by his thought he began to move them upon the chequer, then he perceived that on this day the game was in his hand: for his men obeyed him with so brisk obedience that he saw them moving before ever he knew that his will was set. Also they went no more from his intent, but kept his ordinance and came all together to the stroke: whereby the gold company were discomfited and their king was both checked and mated.</p>

    <p>Then upon the instant came a wind and thunder and lightning, and Ywain's eyes dazzled therewith. And when he opened his eyes again the castle was gone from him utterly, with the windows and the courtyard and the chequer: and he stood in a place of rocks upon a green mound of the forest. And there also he saw his horse beside him saddled and bridled, and upon the saddle bow two crowns, a gold and a silver. And he took the crowns and rode lightly towards the city: and when they of Paladore heard his horn they came forth to meet him, as they had said. Nevertheless the most of them were astonished and some displeased: for they looked not to have seen him again. And the gold crown they took for the Prince, as reason was: but with the silver crown they crowned Ywain and so brought him cityward. And as they went he fell aweary: and the sun set, and the night rose on Paladore.</p>
