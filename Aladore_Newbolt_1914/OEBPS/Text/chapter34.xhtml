    HOW YWAIN AND AITHNE WENT FLYING BETWEEN SUN AND MOON.</h2>

    <p class="firstParagraph">THEN they went hastily until it was past noon, and Ywain would not that they should stint, till at last they wearied both, and lacked strength for lack of meat. And they espied a shepherd's but all lonely among the hills, and it stood fast by a thicket, and they knew not whose it might be, for it was far off from the valley of their dwelling. So they came thither and found it empty, for the shepherds were abroad with their flock. Then they went within the hut and shut to the door and thought to rest them awhile. But Ywain sat him down beside the window and hid himself, that he might keep watch, for he doubted that they were not yet wholly escaped.</p>

    <p>And when he had watched for the space of half an hour he saw how that there was something stirring in the border of the thicket: and presently came forth the young faun, going warily upon his hands and upon his shanks. And he cast about him on this side and on that, nosing the earth as a hound upon the trail: and he began to creep toward the hut, and Ywain moved not but laid hold upon his staff. But in the same moment he looked beyond the faun and saw two shepherds which came coasting the thicket, and he heard their dogs behind them barking and driving in the sheep. And the faun also heard them and was discomfited: for his wits had been all upon the trail and he was well-nigh trapped. And the shepherds saw him and cried out upon him and made to beat him with their crooks, but he ran with great leaps, and passed before them and was gone into the thicket.</p>

    <p>Then Ywain went out to meet the shepherds, and to question them, for he perceived that they were come home from pasture before their time. And they said that they had great need to come, for that there was a gathering of fauns throughout all the country, and it was the time of their madness wherein they would be fell and beastly.</p>

    <p>Then Ywain told his tale also, and they counselled him earnestly to go further, for they understood how that he was hated of the fauns, and belike against him was their gathering, and against none other. So Ywain brought his lady forth in spite of weariness, and the shepherds gave them such meat as they had, and sent them away.</p>

    <p>Then Ywain began to be afeared as he had never been afeared in all his days, for he saw how his lady was fallen lame with the roughness of the hills: and this that was before him was no proper warfare, wherein a man may die reasonably, but a desperate and unclean fortune, to be overtaken by beasts in darkness. And on every wind he heard voices, and behind every tree he saw the shadow of his enemies, so that he went continually as through an ambush, forlorn of hope. But Aithne spoke always with good cheer, and made light of fauns, as one that had a spell to subdue all creatures at her will. And almost Ywain believed her, for she was stedfast beyond all bravery of feigning.</p>

    <p>Then at the last the sun began to fall more swiftly to his setting, and a great perplexity came upon Ywain. For he supposed that in the darkness would be the end of all, but he knew not how nor in what point of time: and he had a longing to say somewhat to Aithne, yet for shame he could not say it, lest by chance after despair there should come deliverance. And therein his heart betrayed him not, for his fortune was better than his fear.</p>

    <p>Thus they continued going forward, and speaking as in hope: and though they spoke deceivingly each to other, yet their spirits were in peace together. And as they went they looked upon the sky westward: and there was a little span between the sun and the sky border, and by that span they saw their life and measured it. And the sky was clear above and without cloud, but the sun was greatening below in a mist of rose: and against the mist was a black jot, as it were a black crow homing towards nightfall. And when it came nearer they saw how it was in bigness greater than a crow and in colour diverse: for the light went through it and yellowed it, and it flew more swiftly than a bird. Also it came with a sound of humming, like a great bee, and the nearer the louder, till the air was shaken with the humming of it, and the blood quickened in them that heard it. And Ywain and Aithne stood still to look upon it, and they saw that it was by seeming a man which flew with wings: and he came over them where they stood and went about them in a circle like a buzzard, wheeling lightly and looking down upon them.</p>

    <p>Then Ywain made a sign requiring succour of him: and he took Aithne into his arms and made to shelter her, and with his staff he swung great strokes about him, as it were against a host of enemies. And his sign was well understanded of him that was flying, for he dropped swiftly down upon the earth, and he put off his wings and came running where Ywain was and Aithne. And they saw how that he was a man like unto themselves, but tall and strong and comely out of measure, and at a word he perceived their peril and the evil malice of the fauns. Then hastily he did on his wings, and he took a thong, and when he had bound Ywain and Aithne with the thong he made them fast beneath his pinions, and so mounted lightly upon the air.</p>

    <p>And Ywain and Aithne looked down and marvelled and held their breath, for the whole earth fell from them suddenly. And for a moment they had sight of fauns, running together like ants beneath them: and then they saw the fauns also fall from them and become as dust. And the sun set, and the moon rose, and they went flying swiftly between the sun and the moon.</p>
